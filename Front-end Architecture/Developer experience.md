## Definition 

Developer Experience (DX) is all about how easily and effectively developer can get things done. It's the experience developers have when using tools and services to analyze, build, test and integrate, deploy and maintain software. 

The idea was influenced by the “user experience” concept (UX), a similar concept that aggregates relevant aspects, is intuitive, and helps organizations to analyze, design or improve products or services

DX consists of experiences relating to all kinds of artifacts and activities that a developer may encounter as part of their involvement in software development. These could roughly be divided into experiences regarding 
1. development infrastructure (e.g. development and management tools, programming languages, libraries, platforms, frame- works, processes, and methods;
2. feelings about work (e.g. respect, attachment, belonging);
3. the value of one’s own contribution (e.g. alignment of one’s own goals with those of the project, plans, intentions, and commitment);
